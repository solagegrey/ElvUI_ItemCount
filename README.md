# ElvUI_ItemCount
ItemCount is an ElvUI datatext plugin that displays the current quantity 
of up to five specified items in your bags (does not include quantities 
held in the bank). When the primary counted item is gathered into your 
inventory, ItemCount will chime and display informational text.

This addon is useful for non-quest items you may be gathering for 
reputation turn-in, such as the Obsidian Warbeads, or the Fertile Spores, 
or the Dread Amber Shards; great for gathering materials like timber, 
Sumptuous Fur, ore, etc.; eliminates the need to keep opening your bags 
to see if you have reached the desired quantity.
