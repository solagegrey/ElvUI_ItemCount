REQUIRES: [ElvUI user interface](https://www.tukui.org/download.php?ui=elvui "Download ElvUI Addon")

Chimes when you collect specified item(s); plays a special sound when you have reached a goal quantity.

ItemCount is an ElvUI datatext plugin that displays the current quantity of up to five specified items in your bags (does not include quantities held in the bank). A primary item will be displayed on the datatext, and all counted items will be displayed in its mouse hover dropdown. A chime will sound when a counted item is placed in your bags, and a specified sound will be played when the quantity of a counted item reaches its specified goal. These sounds can be customized or muted for each item individually.

This addon is useful for quest items or non-quest items you may be gathering for any reason. The obvious example is for gathering professions - herbalism, skinning, mining - when you want to gather a certain number of an item. Other examples: Zskera Vault Keys, Obsidian key fragments (Dragonflight); Obsidian Warbeats, Fertile Spores (Burning Crusade); Dread Amber Shards (Mists of Pandaria); Sumptuous Fur, Timber, etc., (Warlords of Draenor); Love Token, Lovely Charm (Love is in the Air event); Coin of Ancestry (Lunar Festival event).

You will no longer need to keep checking your bags, or to occupy valuable toolbar slots to track these items.

Use the ElvUI Config Panel to configure options:

- change tracked items (or Alt-RightClick an item in your bags)
- track up to 5 different items in the tooltip
- create a goal quantity and alert when reached
- choose the alert sound from a list
- share ItemCount profiles with other characters in your account
